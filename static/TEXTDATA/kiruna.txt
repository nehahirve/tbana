        @hendrikmorkel I joined printer when they started but never uploaded any images. There was something I really, really didn't like about the site but can't even remember what it was.
        @MarkStevensII1 Yes actually. But it really sucks for European customers because the shipping prices are insane. 😣

        @AngryTheInch Well 2020 really has been the longest decade and I think we're all looking forward to 2030.
