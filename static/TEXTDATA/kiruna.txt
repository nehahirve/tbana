        @FrontierAstro No, they have to evacuate the mine for the explosions, which naturally would be a he'll of a lot harder during the day with the amount of people working. :) It's really not an issue, it's rare that it wakes you up. It's more worrying when there's a lack of that boom in the night

        @USEmbassyTurkey @StateDept @SecPompeo The proven most brave women on this planet are Kurdish woman who is on the frontline in the battle with ISIS. And no one is represented here. We Kurds are disappointed.

At least Commander Nesrin would be here who led successfully the operation to liberate Raqqa from ISIS.

        @kuscuozgurr @GiantMTB_275 @Jerusalem_Post I don't understand why you are talking in the name of turks, you are even a turk, you don't even look like mongolians.

I am sure you would loose your sympathies if you know how you as person "converted" to turks. Check the history again how you became turk, check your familytree

        @JeffMumford4 The aurora is a natural phenomenon, depending entirely on the solar activity and of course, the weather since you need a clear sky. There are never any guarantees and anyone who claims they can guarantee it is lying.

Yani icerde kontrol kimdeyse sorumlu odur. T.c. veya pkk farketmez.
