#### A Hyper Island Student Project

**About:**
Using Twitter API, TweetLator is an app that fetches tweets from users in various cities around Sweden, and visualizes their content based on word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and Markov chains.

TweetLator was born during a brainstorming session for a school project at Hyper Island. For the three-week-long project, we decided to blend our brief (building a webpage using RESTful APIs) with our interest in data visualization and graphs. Therefore, working with Twitter API and analyzing their users' content seemed a compelling territory to explore despite being an intact challenge for all of us.

**Data collection method:**

// api 

// node

// sentiment analysis

**Things we learned:**

**Some of the challenges we faced:**

// cors - we couldn’t collect data at fetch time, hence we decided to do it at build time once a week through a series of node scripts.

// we tried to use cytoscape.js


Exploring some of these libraries for the purpose of analyzing text-based content in this project was to experiment with new tools in the field of front-end development. We are front-end developers, not data analysts (although with some background knowledge of linguistics), and it’s likely that we have overlooked some of the nuances of data collection and potential biases.
